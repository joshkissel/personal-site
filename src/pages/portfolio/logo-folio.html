				<h2>Denver Art Museum</h2>
				<h3>Unifying Brand &amp; Architecture</h3>
				<p>This was a school project. In 2006 the
				Frederic C. Hamilton building was opened to the public and has become an
				iconic Denver landmark. I tasked myself to bring the brand
				inline with the architectural and environmental design. In the hopes that
				it would unify the design experince.</p>

				<h2>Gristle Food Truck</h2>
				<h3>You Can Lead a Pig to Beer</h3>
				<p>This was a school project. The project was to create a food truck concept

				that pairs craft beer and BLT sandwiches. Sounds good, right!?</p>

				<h2>Z&oacute;calo</h2>
				<h3>Discover the Source</h3>
				<p>This was also a school group project which involved a true client.
				Our group met with a local coffee shop to learn their design pain points
				and to see where they envisioned their design. Z&oacute;calo is a Spanish
				term for the city square. The logo mark, which was my responsibilty, incorporates a map pin, a (city) square,
				and a mountain silhouette.</p>

				<h2>New Haven and Hartford Railroad</h2>

				the "Going Places" tagliine to help reinvigorate the brand.</p>

				<h2>Studio Marka</h2>
				<h3>The Name Brand</h3>
				<p>This was a student branding agency. The work "Marka" translates roughly
					 to brand in a few languages. It's also a play on a brand "mark" nomenclature.
					  The tagline "The Name Brand" then starts to take on multiple meanings. Really,
					the entire messaging is a giant play on words.</p>
