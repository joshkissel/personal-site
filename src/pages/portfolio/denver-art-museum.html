				<h2>FREDERIC C. HAMILTON BUILDING</h2>
				<h3>Opened October 2006</h3>
				<p>In 2006 the Frederic C. Hamilton building was opened to the public
					and has become an iconic Denver landmark as well as an icon for the Denver
					Art Museum. I tasked myself to bring the brand inline with the
					architectural and environmental design. In the hopes that it would
					unify the design experince.</p>

				<h3>The Current Mark</h3>
				<p>This is the current logo for the Denver Art Musuem. It left me with a few
				questions. Why two typefaces? Why is Denver sans-serif and Art Museum serif?
			 	Where does the green come from? Is this mark identifyable or memerable?
				Now, I have answered these questions for myself but they are more based on
				assumption or opinion so I'll leave it there.</p>
