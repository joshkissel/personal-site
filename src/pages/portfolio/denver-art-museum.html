				<h2>FREDERIC C. HAMILTON BUILDING</h2>
				<h3>Opened October 2006</h3>
				<p>In 2006 the Frederic C. Hamilton building was opened to the public
					and has become an iconic Denver landmark as well as an icon for the Denver
					Art Museum. I tasked myself to bring the brand inline with the
					architectural and environmental design. In the hopes that it would
					unify the design experince.</p>

				<h2>Denver Art Museum</h2>
				<h3>The Current Mark</h3>
				<p>This is the current logo for the Denver Art Musuem. It left me with a few
				questions. Why two typefaces? Why is Denver sans-serif and Art Museum serif?
			 	Where does the green come from? Is this mark identifyable or memerable?
				Now, I have answered these questions for myself but they are more based on
				assumption or opinion so I'll leave it there.</p>

				<h2>Denver Art Museum</h2>
				<h3>The Proposed Mark</h3>
				<p>The icon is meant to reference the buildings geometry, intersecting planes,
				and cantilever design without directly showing the building. The type  is
				meant to compliment the geometric nature without taking too much of the spotlight.
				Finally, the yellow is pulled from environnmental elements within the first
				floor interiot of the museum.</p>

				<h2>Business Cards</h2>
				<h3>Introducing the Brand Language</h3>
				<p>I wanted to apply the new design language to a few pieces. I wanted
				to design items that would have the most museum patron interaction. The card
				uses the angle from the icon and the type lies on a grid based on the same
				angle.</p>

				<h2>General Admission Tickets</h2>
				<h3>Tickets, Tickets Please!</h3>
				<p>These are the general, one day admission tickets. As I designed more
				pieces I realized that the yellow with the angle from the icon mark was
				becoming the brand. The ticket stubs are perforated at the same angle and
				create a fun momento.</p>

				<h2>Website</h2>
				<h3>What Do Users Want?</h3>
				<p>After conducting a few interviews I found that museum website users
					want/ go to the site for two things. First and formost users go to the
					site to find out the museum is open and/or their general hours. Two,
					users go to site to find out what the current exhibits are. By implementing
					both answers above the fold most users needs were satisfied quickly and
					on the first page.</p>
