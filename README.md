## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

This template can be installed with the Foundation CLI, or downloaded and set up manually.

### Running Project

`cd` to your cloned repo and to install dependencies to run locally. 

```bash
npm install 
```

### Watch

While inside of your app's folder, use the `watch` command to assemble your app and run a test server.

```bash
foundation watch
```

While this process is running, you can view the assembled app in your browser, at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8001
```

While the server is running, any changes you make to your HTML, Sass, or JavaScript will automatically be processed and added to your live app.

### Build

To build your app for production, use `foundation build`.

```bash
foundation build
```

### Update

Updates your Bower packages, which includes Foundation. Run this command when you want to update an existing project to the newest version of Foundation.

```bash
foundation update
```

### Help

```bash
foundation help
```

Add a command name at the end to learn how a specific command works.

```bash
foundation help new
```
